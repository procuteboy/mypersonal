\begin{abstract}
By considering Higgs modes within the Ginzburg-Landau framework, we study influences of a rotated magnetic field on
the color-flavor-locked-type matter of dense QCD. We demonstrate, in a model-independent way, that a diquark condensate
may be triggered by the magnetic response of rotated-charged Higgs modes, in addition to the known color-flavor-locked 
condensate.
Moreover, the condensate is applied to explore formations of vortices in the presence of external magnetic fields. The superfluid-like vortices are constructed for the magnetic-induced condensate. In the situation including both kinds of condensates, the theoretical possibility of vortons is suggested and the formation condition and the energy stability are investigated semi-classically.

\section{Introduction}
Strongly interacting matter under the influence of magnetic fields has attracted intensive interests
in recent years, due to the realistic relevance to phenomenology in relativistic heavy-ion collisions
and astrophysical objects in the universe, for recent reviews, see, e.g., ~\cite{andersen2016phase,kharzeev2013strongly}.
In heavy ion collision experiments, a strong magnetic field up to $eB \sim 2m_{\pi}^2$ with $m_{\pi}$
the pion mass, i.e., $B \sim 10^{18}\text{G}$ can be produced in non-central collisions at Relativistic Heavy
Ion Collider (RHIC), and $B \sim 10^{20}\text{G}$ at Large Hadron Collider (LHC)~\cite{kharzeev2008,skokov2009}.
For astrophysics objects, the magnetic fields as large as
$B \sim 10^{14}$ - $10^{15}\text{G}$ exist on the surface of Magnetars. While the strength
can reach $B \sim 10^{18}\text{G}$ in the interior of regular neutron stars, a theoretical upper limit to the magnetic field may stand as high as $B \sim 10^{20}\text{G}$ inside self-bound compact stars~\cite{dong2001,lai1991cold}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Under such circumstances of strong magnetic fields,
answer to the question of how the Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase structure can be modified remains
one of the major theoretical challenges. For instance, at vanishing chemical potential, a general effect
of magnetic field on the vacuum structure of QCD is an enhancement of the dynamical symmetry breaking,
a phenomenon usually referred to as ``magnetic catalysis''~\cite{miransky2015quantum}. At zero
temperature, recent lattice QCD study of the behavior of the $u$- and $d$-quark condensates in
magnetic fields has confirmed the magnetic catalysis phenomena, however, for temperatures of the order of
the crossover temperature, a decrease of the quark condensates is found, this is so called ``inverse
magnetic catalysis'' effect at certain values of the magnetic
field~\cite{bali2012,miransky2002,fukushima2012}.
Up to date, the mapping of QCD phase diagram onto the temperature and 
magnetic field plane has not been firmly established.
%%%

Further, through intensive studies in past decades, it is realized that there exists so-called color
superconducting phase of quark matter at high density regime (see, e.g.
Refs.~\cite{alford2004dense,buballa2005njl}). In the scope of color superconducting matter, it is of
great interest to investigate which modifications are induced by the magnetic-field background.
%%%%%%%
Besides its theoretical implication to the QCD phase diagram, this topic might be very important for the physics of magnetars since 
the inner region of compact stars is suggested to consist of color superconductors.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%color superconductivity is likely to be observed 
%%the star interior as well as magnetars are likely to have color-superconducting cores.
%% because of its astrophysical applications. 
%It is very likely that the inner region of compact stars consists of color superconductors. On the other hand, it is realized that strong magnetic background fields usually exist in such kind of environment, e.g. the neutron star interior and/or the so-called magnetars.
%Therefore, a detailed study of the magnetic effect may be very  possible observation of color superconductivity as well as .
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
As the most typical color superconductor, the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase is widely believed to be
the ground state of QCD at extremely high density and low temperature~\cite{alford1998qcd}. Due to the
diquark condensates formed in the CFL phase, the symmetry breaking pattern is
\begin{eqnarray}
G=SU(3)_{C}\times SU(3)_{L} \nonumber
\times SU(3)_{R}\times U(1)_{B} \\
\rightarrow H=SU(3)_{C+L+R}\equiv SU(3)_{C+F},\label{cfl}
\end{eqnarray}
where the approximate symmetry $U(1)_{A}$ in $G$ and the discrete symmetries in $H$ have been ignored.
It means that an original QCD symmetry, including color, flavor (left- and right-hand) and baryon number
symmetries, is broken down to the color-flavor locked symmetry.
The main feature relevant for magnetic effect is the rotated electromagnetic mechanism, namely an unbroken
$U(1)_{\widetilde{Q}}$ group is embedded in the color-flavor locked subgroup where the rotated electric
charge is defined by $\widetilde{Q}=Q_{F}\times {1}_{C}-{1}_{F}\times Q_{C}$ in the color-flavor space.
As the spin-$0$ color superconductor, the diquark condensates in CFL are always neutral in the sense of
rotated charge.
Since CFL is not electromagnetic superconductor, there is no Meissner effect and the unscreened magnetic
fields propagate unscreened inside the color-superconducting matter~\cite{alford1998qcd,alford2000magnetic}.
In the situation of strong gauge coupling, the rotated electromagnetic field, as the combination of
electromagnetic and gluon fields~\cite{alford1998qcd,alford2000magnetic}, is made up mostly of a usual
electromagnetic field. Thus, the rotated magnetic field can be described by an external background field
$B$ and the unit of rotated charge can be given by an electron charge $e$ approximately.

By introducing an applied field $B$, there exist considerable changes in the properties of color
superconductor. For three-flavor color-flavor-locked-type matter, in particular, the original symmetry
breaking pattern is possible to become violated. Once strong magnetic fields are introduced, the
color-flavor-locked group is broken as
\begin{eqnarray}
H\rightarrow M=SU(2)_{C+F},\label{cfl2}\end{eqnarray}
which corresponds to the magnetic color-flavor locked phase
(MCFL) \cite{ferrer2005magnetic,fukushima2008color,ferrer2006color,ferrer2007magnetic}.
In the literatures, the MCFL phase was mainly investigated by a phenomenological Nambu-Jona Lasinio (NJL)
model with four-quark interactions and many studies were devoted to the magnetic-field dependence of
color-superconducting gaps.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
From the NJL numerical calculations, the gaps are observed to display de Haas-van Alphen
oscillation \cite{ferrer2005magnetic,fukushima2008color}.
The NJL analytical derivation is valid in the limit of strong magnetic field. There, it is found that
the large magnetic fields could enhance the specific gap \cite{ferrer2006color,sen2015anisotropic} which
might be considered as a generic magnetic catalysis.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Alternatively, the color-superconducting phase and the inhomogeneous topological vortices consisting of it can be studied in a model-independent Ginzburg-Landau (GL) framework, see, e.g., ~\cite{giannakis2002ginzburg,iida2002superfluid,balachandran2006semisuperfluid,nakano2008non,eto2014vortices}.
%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
To account for the CFL phase, the GL Lagrangian can be developed from the symmetry breaking pattern Eq.~(\ref{cfl}).
The diquark-condensate order parameter is usually described by a $3\times3$ matrix, which is rather simple with
respect to a $72 \times 72$ matrix in the phenomenological model of quarks. Consequently, the relevant degree
of freedom (dof) are the Higgs modes, i.e., fluctuations of diquark condensates, rather than the microscopic
quarks and gluons dof. In a previous work~\cite{zhang2015magnetic}, we had investigated magnetic response of the Higgs modes 
preliminarily. In the present work, the magnetic effect will be further explored via the systematic GL analyses. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Our attention focus on the case that the magnitude of magnetic field is larger than the threshold. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
On the one hand, the studies in this paper is going to shed light on some unknown aspects regarding magnetic response of the rotated-charged Higgs modes.
Specifically, the additional diquark condensate induced by an applied field $B$ is stressed to be necessary for color-flavor-locked breaking and modification of the ground state. In the resulting less-symmetric ground state, we explain the magnetic-field dependence of MCFL gap(s) qualitatively. 

On the other hand, the GL theory is an useful tool for exploring the topological objects such
as the spatial-dependent vortices. In the literatures, the superfluid vortices and the so-called non-Abelian vortices have been suggested for color-flavor-locked-type matter.
%%%%%%%
%In recent years various types of vortices have been considered in color superconducting matter of dense QCD.
%Within the GL framework, the superfluid vortices and the so-called non-Abelian vortices were suggested for
%color-flavor-locked-type matter (see, e.g.
%Refs.~\cite{balachandran2006semisuperfluid,nakano2008non,vinci2012spontaneous,
%eto2014vortices,eto2010instabilities}).
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
One must note that the formation mechanism of these vortices are irrelevant to an external magnetic
field. Henceforth, it is one of the important issues to study the vortices consisting of MCFL. By taking
the magnetic-induced condensate into account, we will investigate two kinds of vortex solutions in the presence of magnetic fields.
Besides the superfluid-like vortices, the scenario of
topologically and energetically stable vortons is suggested in the present work. Both of theoretical possibilities
are pointed out for the first time and they might have potential applications in the astrophysical environment.

This paper is structured as follows. After a brief review of the GL formalism accounting for CFL, in
Sec.~\ref{sec:2}, particular emphases are placed on the magnetic response of charged Higgs modes and its
consequences. In Sec.~\ref{sec:3}, we study the formations of superfluid-like vortices and vortons 
for different magnetic fields and boundary conditions. Sec.~\ref{sec:4} is
devoted to summary and discussions of some open problems.

\section{Magnetic-induced condensate}
%\subsection{
\label{sec:2}
%\vspace{0.2cm}
\subsection{Higgs masses as GL coefficients}
\label{sssec:1}
%

The GL Lagrangian of most-symmetric CFL phase is developed from the symmetry breaking pattern in Eq.~(\ref{cfl}) and it is invariant
under the original symmetries $G=SU(3)_C \times SU(3)_L\times SU(3)_R\times\times U(1)_B$. Within the GL framework, the
diquark-condensate order parameter is denoted as a complex $3\times3$ matrix $\Phi_L$ and $\Phi_R$.
In the chiral limit, we assume that $\Phi_L = \Phi_R = \Phi$.
Under the notation
$i = 1, 2, 3 = u, d, s$ and $\alpha = 1, 2, 3 = r, g, b$, the matrix element $\Phi_{i \alpha}$ accounts
for the pairing of quarks with non-$\alpha$ colors and non-$i$ flavors \cite{iida2002superfluid}, or might be expressed  as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:diquarkmatrix}
  \Phi =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \Phi_{gb}^{ds} &  \Phi_{gb}^{su} & \Phi_{gb}^{ud} \\
    \Phi_{br}^{ds} &  \Phi_{br}^{su} & \Phi_{br}^{ud} \\
    \Phi_{rg}^{ds} &  \Phi_{rg}^{su} & \Phi_{rg}^{ud}
  \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
to account for possible pairings between the quarks with different colors and flavors.
The diagonal elements belong to color-flavor-locked species whereas the non-diagonal elements, as
color-flavor-unlocked species, are not allowed in the ideal CFL phase.
 In the weak coupling, a general GL Lagrangian 
%referred in~\cite{iida2002superfluid,giannakis2002ginzburg} 
is given by
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}= \frac{1}{4} (f_{\mu\nu})^2 +
\text{Tr}\left[\kappa_3(\vec{\mathcal{D}}\Phi)^\dagger\vec{\mathcal{D}}\Phi
  -\alpha\Phi^\dagger\Phi -\beta_2(\Phi^\dagger\Phi)^2\right]
-\beta_1(\text{Tr}[\Phi^\dagger\Phi])^2 +\cdots ,\label{gl}
\end{equation}
where the constant term for vanishing vacuum energy and the term for rotated gluonic fields have been
ignored.

Due to the rotated electromagnetic field $\vec{A}$ is introduced and the rotated gluonic fields have been ignored,
the covariant derivatives and field strengths are
\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{\mathcal{D}}\Phi &=\vec{\nabla} \Phi -ie\vec{A} T_{\widetilde{Q}}\Phi,\\
f_{\mu\nu} &= \partial_\mu A_\nu -\partial_\nu A_\mu
\end{eqnarray}
Notice that the generator $T_{\widetilde{Q}}$ is different from the generator $T_{\text{EM}} = 1/3\text{diag}(-2,1,1)$ which
is the description of the flavors charge. For us, the generator $T_{\widetilde{Q}}$ is the 
description of the rotated charges of quark pairing. Considering that only the CFL condensates are allowed in the CFL phase and are rotated-charge
neutral. Therefore they would not be affected by the rotated magnetic field.



For the CFL phase, only the diagonal elements are involved in the diquark matrix, namely
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:phi}
  \Phi =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    d & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & d & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & d
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
 
 
% They are rotated-charge neutral and the corresponding Higgs
% modes are also neutral. Since these modes do not respond to magnetic field directly, the above effective Lagrangian usually does
% not influence the CFL description.
% By inserting Eq.~(\ref{eq:phi})
% into the GL Lagrangian,
%  the Lagrangian  of the CFL-diquark condensates reads
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:vd}
% \mathcal{L}_d =(\partial d)(\partial d^*) -\alpha d^2 - 3\beta_1 d^4 -\beta_2 d^4.
% \end{equation}
% Due to  $T_{\widetilde{Q}} = 0$, there is no direct correlation term about the magnetic field.

The vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the diquark condensate is
\begin{equation}
  \text{VEV}(\Phi)=\text{diag}(v,v,v) ,\label{cflground}
\end{equation}
where the diagonal elements have been assumed to be equal \cite{iida2002superfluid}. 
the value of
$v$ corresponds to a degenerated CFL gap and it is obtained from
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dvaccum}
v^2 = -\frac{\alpha}{3\beta_1+\beta_2}.
\end{equation}
% Then the GL potential can be also rewritten as a Mexican-hat-shape form
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:dpotential}
% \mathcal{V}_d \sim - \alpha(d^2 - v^2)^2.
% \end{equation}
Note that the coefficient $\alpha$ is responsible for the existence of color-flavor-locked condensate
and hence is always negative, while the coefficients $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are positive.


According to the symmetry breaking patten shown in the Eq.~(\ref{cfl}),
the Higgs modes appear as fluctuations of diquark condensate around the
CFL vacuum. Since the order parameter space is $G/H \simeq U(3)$, the Higgs modes are made up of the
singlet field $\phi$ and the octet fields $\zeta^a$ ($a = 1, 2, \cdots, 8$). Explicitly, these
collective modes can be given by perturbing the order-parameter matrix
\begin{eqnarray}
\Phi=v\textbf{1}_3+\frac{\phi+i\varphi}{\sqrt{2}}\textbf{1}_3+\frac{\zeta^a+i\chi^a}{\sqrt{2}}T^a,
\label{pert}
\end{eqnarray}
where $T^a$ is the generators of $U(3)$ with $\text{Tr}[T^a T^b]=\delta^{ab}$.
In Eq.~(\ref{pert}), the singlet field $\varphi$ and the octet fields $\chi^a$ correspond one to
one to the Higgs fields $\phi$ and $\zeta^a$, respectively. They belong to the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone
modes.

Based on the Eq.~(\ref{gl}), the Higgs
masses are obtained,
\begin{eqnarray}
m_\phi^2=\frac{-2\alpha}{k_3},\\ m_\zeta^2=\frac{4\beta_2}{\kappa_3}
	v^2,\label{mhiggs}
\end{eqnarray}
which could be treated as the GL coefficients equivalently. In terms of these Higgs masses, the GL
potential can be expressed in the form, i.e.
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{V}_\phi=
\frac{m_\phi^2}{12v^2}\kappa_3(\text{Tr}[\Phi^\dagger\Phi-v^2])^2,
\label{glmphi}
\end{eqnarray}
and
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{V}_\zeta=
\frac{m_\zeta^2}{4v^2}\kappa_3\text{Tr}\left[\left<\Phi^\dagger\Phi\right>^2\right],
\label{glzeta}
\end{eqnarray}
where the definition $\left<M\right>\equiv M-(1/N)\text{Tr}M$ is used for a $N\times N$ matrix $M$.
There the potential term $\mathcal{V}_\phi$ with the singlet Higgs mass $m_{\phi}$ accounts for the trace contribution.
the potential term $\mathcal{V}_\zeta$ with the octet Higgs mass $m_{\zeta}$ represents the traceless contribution.
More precisely, the trace contribution is relevant to the $\Phi_L^\dagger\Phi_L$ and $\Phi_R^\dagger\Phi_R$ only.
Whereas the traceless contribution is relevant to not only $\Phi_L^\dagger\Phi_L$ and $\Phi_R^\dagger\Phi_R$ 
but also $\Phi_R^\dagger\Phi_L$ and $\Phi_L^\dagger\Phi_R$.








\subsection{An effective Lagrangian with in-medium Higgs mass}
\label{sssec:2}
%\vspace{0.2cm}

Since the diagonal elements are not influenced by the rotated magnetic field,
let us try to explore the possible magnetic effect originated from the non-diagonal elements.
Among these non-diagonal
elements, $\Phi_{br}^{ud}$ and $\Phi_{rg}^{su}$ are neutral while $\Phi_{gb}^{su}$, $\Phi_{gb}^{ud}$, $\Phi_{br}^{ds}$ and $\Phi_{rg}^{ds}$ have the
nonzero charges and their  rotated-charge $\widetilde{Q}$ are $+1,+1,-1,-1$  respectively.
As expected, the generator $T_{\widetilde{Q}}$ is given by 
\begin{equation}
T_{\widetilde{Q}} = \begin{pmatrix}
            &    +1  & +1\\
    -1 &            &      \\
    -1 &            &
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}


Although these matrix elements are not allowed in CFL phase, we assume that they are excited as charged Higgs fields $\delta$
around the CFL vacuum,
due to the external magnetic field is introduced.
Instead of Eq.~(\ref{eq:phi}),
the diquark matrix reads:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:diquarkmatrix0}
\Phi = \begin{pmatrix} v & \delta & \delta \\ \delta^* &  v & 0 \\ \delta^* & 0 & v\end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
here we have assigned the known vacuum $v$.




For a given direction, we introduce the rotated electromagnetic field $\vec{A}$
\begin{equation}
\vec{A} = (0,xB,0),
\end{equation}
which is taken in the Landau gauge.
And the covariant derivative acting on $\Phi$ is
\begin{equation}
\vec{\mathcal{D}} \rightarrow (\partial + i e \vec{A})\Phi.
\end{equation}
In the rest frame, the covariant derivative term is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:derive}
 \text{Tr}\left[\kappa_3(\vec{\mathcal{D}}\Phi)^\dagger\vec{\mathcal{D}}\Phi \right]\simeq 4\kappa_3*((\partial \delta)(\partial \delta^*) -v_\perp^2 eB\delta^2),
\end{equation}
 at the leading order.
Here we have ignored the applied field term $\frac{1}{4}(f_{\mu\nu})^2 \rightarrow \frac{1}{2}B^2$.
Eq.~\eqref{eq:derive} shows that there exists additional quadratic $\delta$  term modified by the magnetic field.
It will lead to the Higgs modes unstable and  corresponding physical effects.


Alternatively, we adopt the framework with $m_\zeta^2$ as GL coefficient Sec.\ref{sssec:1}.
As mentioned in Ref.\cite{zhang2015magnetic},  the magnetic field effect for the charged Higgs modes
can be attributed to
the change of the corresponding coefficient $m_\zeta^2$, i.e., $m_\zeta^2 \rightarrow (m_\zeta^{eff})^2$.
At the leading order, $(m_\zeta^{eff})^2$ was expressed as $m_\zeta^2 -v_\perp^2 eB$.
Instead of introducing the electromagnetic field in the covariant derivative term directly,
we can also adopt the replacement with magnetic-dependent coefficient (or in-medium mass) for the charged-Higgs modes, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{V}_\zeta=
\frac{(m_\zeta^{eff})^2}{4v^2}\kappa_3\text{Tr}\left[\left<\Phi^\dagger\Phi\right>^2\right].
\end{equation}



By plugging the Eq.~\eqref{eq:diquarkmatrix},
the GL potential  is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:deltapotential1}
\mathcal{V}(\Phi) \sim  \alpha' \delta^2 + \beta'\delta^4 + \cdots,
\end{equation}
with
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:coefficients}
\alpha' \equiv (m_\zeta^{eff})^2\kappa_3,
\end{eqnarray}
and
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:coefficients2}\beta' \equiv (\frac{(m_\zeta^{eff})^2}{6v^2} + \frac{4 m_\phi^2}{3v^2})\kappa_3.
\end{eqnarray}
In Eq.~\eqref{eq:deltapotential1}, the $\delta^2$ term corresponds to the contributions of the instability of the charged Higgs mode.
If understanding the magnetic
effect as a relative rotation of the $\Phi_L$ and  $\Phi_R$ orientations, therefore, these terms have different
magnetic responses.
Physically speaking, it is originated from $\Phi_L = \Phi_R$ violated by magnetic field.
For $\delta^4$ term, it is also relevant to the medium. The reason is that $\Phi_L$ and $\Phi_R$ influence not only the $\delta^2$ term
but also $\delta^4$ term, such as  $\kappa_3\text{Tr}[(\mathcal{D}\Phi_L)^\dagger(\mathcal{D}\Phi_R) \Phi_R^\dagger\Phi_L]$.
In fact, the treatment above is more convenient for us to explore the properties of the charged Higgs condensate later.
\subsection{Dynamics of Higgs condensate}
% From Eq.~\eqref{eq:vdelta}, we can see that $\delta^2$ term
% is  determined by $m_\zeta^2$. And this kind of Higgs modes have  non-zero rotated charge, 
% they will be directly affected by the external magnetic 
% field. One of the simple forms that reflects this kind of magnetic effect is to replace the original coefficient $m_\zeta^2$ with 
%  with magnetic-dependent coefficient $(m_\zeta^{eff})^2$, where $(m_\zeta^{eff})^2 \simeq m_\zeta^2 - v_\perp^2eB$ 
% at the leading order.

% In fact, this conclusion can be also derived by 
% the standard procedure of covariant derivatives for the order parameter $\Phi$.
% For a given direction magnetic field, we introduced a rotated magnetic field $\widetilde{A}_\perp$.
% Then the covariant derivative acting on $\Phi$ becomes $(\partial_\perp + i\widetilde{e}\widetilde{A}_\perp)\Phi$.
% In the rest frame, the Lagrange for $\delta$ field becomes
% \begin{equation}
% \mathcal{L}_\delta= |\partial_\parallel \delta|^2 +|(\partial_\perp + i\widetilde{e}\widetilde{A}_\perp)\delta|^2 + m_\zeta^2 \delta^2 + (\frac{4 m_\phi^2}{3v^2}+\frac{m_\zeta^2}{6v^2})\delta^4=
% |\partial \delta|^2 + m_\zeta^2 \delta^2 + (\frac{4 m_\phi^2}{3v^2}+\frac{m_\zeta^2}{6v^2})\delta^4 -v_\perp^2 \widetilde{e}B \delta^2 + \cdots . 
% \end{equation}
% 




%

As the $\delta^2$ coefficient, $\alpha'$ stems from the squared mass $(m_\zeta^{eff})^2$. Noticing that the effective mass decreases with the field $B$, the coefficient $\alpha'$ is possible to disappear and even take a negative value. In the GL analysis with a given order parameter, the sign of coefficient in quadratic term
determines whether or not the order parameter acquire its nontrivial vacuum.
Obviously, the vanishing $\alpha'$ is a signature of the
$\delta$ condensate. Thus, the quantity $B_0$ obtained from $\alpha' \rightarrow 0$ is just the
threshold field for the emergence of the $\delta$ condensate.
For the magnetic field with $B > B_0$, moreover, $\alpha'$ (being negative) is no longer the usual squared mass defined in the known CFL phase. Instead, it reflects the fact that the charged Higgs modes behave as unstable modes
with the negative energy such as $E^2(k=0)=(m_\zeta^{eff})^2<0$. In the case of a Mexican-hat-shape potential of a scalar field, as well known, it is excitation of unstable modes around the original minimum to lead to the presence of new stable vacuum.  
Similar excitations of the charged Higgs modes arise and it eventually leads to the presence of the $\delta$ condensate.
This is just the dynamical mechanism of magnetic-induced condensate $\delta$.


As for the coefficient $\beta'$, it is partially magnetic dependent. Throughout the current work we
shall consider the situation with positive $\beta'$, otherwise, the existence of $\delta$ is not
theoretically controllable. The possibility of $\beta'< 0$ happens for relatively strong fields, say,
$B \geq 9 B_0$ from numerical estimates, which is beyond the scope of our consideration.


By minimizing the relevant part of Eq.~(\ref{eq:deltapotential1}), the vacuum value of $\delta$ condensate is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vacuumexpectation}
v_\delta^2 = \frac{- \alpha'} {2\beta'},
\end{equation}
such that the potential can be rewritten as a Mexican-hat-shape form
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:deltapotential}
\mathcal{V}_\delta \sim - \alpha'(\delta^2 - v_\delta^2)^2.
\end{equation}
Eq.~(\ref{eq:vacuumexpectation}) is analogous to the form $\mathcal{V}_d \sim - \alpha (d^2 - v^2)^2$
for the $d$ condensate.

From our estimate, we take $v_\perp^2=1/3$ and adopt $\beta_2$ as
the $0.5$ value, further, we might yield the threshold value $eB_0 = 12\beta_2 v^2 \simeq 6v^2$.
Furthermore, if choosing the CFL gap $v = 50$~MeV and perform a rough estimate, the threshold magnetic field could reach the
order of $10^{17}\text{G}$ and the $\delta$ condensate reach the $v$ value at about $3eB_0$. Numerically, such a magnitude is comparable to the estimated value of
magnetic fields in the core of neutron stars, but it is still less than the theoretical upper
limit $10^{20}\text{G}$ inside self-bound magnetars~\cite{dong2001,lai1991cold}.
Although we have given the threshold value of the new charged Higgs condensates,
we have to admit that our estimates are roughly.
In our GL analysis, we have assumed that the vacuum expectation value of the CFL condensate $v$ is magnetic field independent 
(see details in Ref.\cite{ferrer2006color}).


%%%%%%%%%%
%Physically speaking, on the other hand, there are some of differences in the two cases. While $d$ does not respond to magnetic field directly, $\delta$ originates from magnetic response of charged Higgs modes. Thus, the latter triggers the new ground state (MCFL) and its introduction essentially comes from the non-Abelian feature of Eq.(\ref{cfl}) and the rotated charge defined by an unbroken $U(1)_{\widetilde{Q}}$ symmetry.
%%%%%%%%%%%
%The GL analyses with the $\delta$ condensate will provide more rich physics

% \subsection{MCFL gap behavior }
% \label{sssec:3}
% %\vspace{0.2cm}

% As the application, let us examine how the MCFL gap vary with magnetic fields.
% Different from the CFL vacuum Eq.~(\ref{cflground}), Eq.~(\ref{eq:mcflgap}) involves both vacuum
% expectations simultaneously. Unfortunately, neither $v_\delta$ nor $v$ can be considered as the
% MCFL gap directly. As stressed at the beginning of Sec.~\ref{sssec:2}, the present discussion is
% limited in the ideal situation with an uniform color-superconducting gap. In this sense, it is
% necessary to convert Eq.~(\ref{eq:mcflgap}) into a more proper form for studies of gap behavior.
% %%

% Without loss of generality, the transformation such as $\Phi \rightarrow \Phi'= U ^\dagger\Phi U$
% is feasible with an action $U$ built in the space of diquark with color and flavor.
% %%
% For our purpose, the ground state with non-diagonal matrix elements needs to be converted into
% the state with
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:effectivegap}
% \text{VEV}(\Phi') = \begin{pmatrix} v_{eff} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & v_{eff} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & v_{eff} \end{pmatrix}.
% \end{equation}
% %%under an appropriate action %defined in the diquark space.
% %%%%%%%%%
% % \begin{equation}\Phi \rightarrow \Phi'= U ^\dagger\Phi U,\label{symm}\end{equation}
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Now the diagonal element $v_{eff}$, as a uniform vacuum expectation of diquark condensate, may be
% understood as the effective gap, even though it does not correspond to the MCFL gaps calculated in
% NJL model in a very strict sense. Due to $U \in SU(3)_C \times SU(3)_F$, a determinant manipulation
% for two matrices yields the relationship like
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq:det}
% \text {det}  \begin{pmatrix} v & v_\delta & v_\delta \\ v_\delta &  v & 0 \\ v_\delta & 0 & v \end{pmatrix}=  \text {det} \begin{pmatrix} v_{eff} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & v_{eff} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & v_{eff} \end{pmatrix}.
% \end{equation}
% In such a simple way, the gap behavior in the MCFL phase may be reproduced qualitatively.
% %%

% Within the present framework, $v$ has been regarded as a known parameter, or the CFL gap.
% %%
% By using the simplification $\beta_1=\beta_2=\beta = 1$ and the numerical estimate Eq.~(\ref{eq:magneticmass}),
% the vacuum defined by Eq.~(\ref{eq:vacuumexpectation}) is expressed as
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:vdelta2}
% v_\delta = v \Big(\frac{3eB-36v^2}{108v^2-eB}\Big)^{1/2}.
% \end{equation}
% Eq.~(\ref{eq:vdelta2}) is valid only for $B > B_0$ and $B < 9B_0$. Numerically, the former
% corresponds to $eB > 12v^2$, which can be seen from the numerator, and the latter to $eB < 108v^2$
% from the denominator in Eq.~(\ref{eq:vdelta2}). Again, as mentioned before, the latter originates
% from the constraint of $\beta'> 0$.
% As shown by the dashed line in Fig.~\ref{fig:1}, $v_\delta$ keeps an increasing function of
% magnetic field.

% For the value of $v_{eff}$, it is required to be positive (as an effective gap).
% Depending on varying magnetic fields, there are the different results derived from Eq.~(\ref{eq:det}).
% For weak magnetic fields (but larger than the threshold value), the magnitude of $v_\delta$ remains
% small relative to $v$. In this situation, Eq.~(\ref{eq:det}) is reduced to
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:veff1}
% v_{eff} =  (v^3-2 vv_\delta^2)^{1/3},
% \end{equation}
% %%%%%%%
% so that the effective gap is firstly suppressed with introducing $eB$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:1}).

% With increasing magnetic fields, on the other hand, the magnitude of $v_\delta$ is possible to
% become dominant (relative to $v$). In this situation, we have to perform the absolute value of
% Eq.~(\ref{eq:veff1}) by hand. By inserting the result of $v_\delta$, we obtain the $B$ dependence
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:veffchanged}
% v_{eff} = v \Big(\frac{7eB-180v^2}{108v^2-eB}\Big)^{1/3}.
% \end{equation}
% From the numerator of Eq.~(\ref{eq:veffchanged}), the vanishing gap is found to be $eB\simeq 180v^2/7$
% ($B \simeq 2.1 B_0$).
% When the magnetic field exceeds this value, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:1}, a steadily increasing function
% is observed for the effective gap. Thus, this inflection point may reflect the ``transition" from a weak
% decreasing tendency to a strong increasing tendency. Of course, such an artificial point originates from
% uncertainties behind our estimate hence its result should not be taken too seriously.

% 	\label{fig:1}
% \end{figure}

% To this end, we would like to address on the magnetic-field dependence of $v_{eff}$. In the
% present GL analysis, the so-called ``strong field" means that $B$ is in a regime
% $2.1 B_0 < B \ll 9 B_0$, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:1}. Note that, for such a finite regime,
% the ratio $v^2/eB$ can be safely regarded as a small quantity and the numerator of
% Eq.~(\ref{eq:veffchanged}) provides a more obvious dependence than the denominator part.
% %%%%%%
% %%
% Roughly, we might expand the numerator by the power series of $v^2/eB$. With respect to the
% maximum value, say, $\sim 100$ MeV, possible for color-superconducting gap, the dimensionless
% form of $v_{eff}$ is simplified as
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:expansion1}
%  v_{eff} \sim 1 - a_1 \frac{v^2}{eB} + \cdots \ ,
% \end{equation}
% at the leading order. There, the value of $a_1$ is found to be positive which ensures the
% monotonic tendency of effective gap.
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%peng%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% %%

% On the NJL-model side, the equation of MCFL gap(s) had been derived analytically for strong
% magnetic fields, where only the lowest Landau level is occupied.
% %% and thus the  derivation of gap equation is possible).
% The ``strong field" means that $eB$ is approximately the order of the square of quark chemical
% potential $\mu_q^2$. Particularly for the $\widetilde{Q}$-relevant gap, it was discovered that
% the dimensionless form like
% $\Delta \sim \text{exp}{[-{3\pi^2 \Lambda^2}/{(g^2\mu_q^2+ g^2 eB)}]}$~\cite{ferrer2006color},
% %%%$\sim \text{exp}(-\frac{3\pi^2 \Lambda^2}{g^2(\mu_q^2+eB)})$
% where $g$ stands for a dimensionless coupling coefficient and $\Lambda$ is a cutoff of energy.
% %%%%%%%%
% For the above result, we should devote ourselves to the $eB$ dependence rather than the $\mu_q$ dependence.
% In order to ``remove" the $\mu_q$ dependence formally, the limit of $\mu_q^2 = eB/2$
% needs to be adopted which was proved important for the self-consistency in our concerned situation with a uniform
% gap~\cite{sen2015anisotropic}. By considering the specific limit and employing the power-series method again, the
% leading-order expansion of $\Delta$ is formally written as $\sim 1 - a_2 \Lambda^2/eB + \cdots$.
% Since $\Lambda^2/eB$ itself is not small enough, the value of $a_2$ might be significantly deviated from $a_1$ in
% Eq.~(\ref{eq:expansion1}). Even so, $a_2$ is still required to be positive. In this sense, the dependence of
% $\Delta$ on strong magnetic fields displays a qualitative similarity as that of $v_{eff}$.
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The similarity becomes invalid completely in vicinity of the inflection point shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:1}. 
% %%%%%%%
% %This artificial point originates from uncertainties behind our estimate and the result in vicinity of it should not be taken too seriously.

% In the NJL numerical calculations the de Haas-van Alphen oscillations of MCFL gap(s) were
% observed~\cite{ferrer2005magnetic,fukushima2008color}, although some recent studies suggest that parts of

% Obviously, the exotic gap behavior failed to be reproduced in our result. 
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% In fact, the present-concerned MCFL phase does not strictly correspond to that studied by using phenomenological quark models. There are some of differences between our model-independent treatment and the usual
% NJL calculations.
% Among them the essential one is that no Landau Level for quarks is introduced in the present analysis, which might explain why we are not able to yield gap oscillations in Fig.~\ref{fig:1}. 
% We are actually concerned the magnetic response of charged Higgs modes, rather than that of charged quarks.

% Of course, the GL treatment is a prior analysis based on symmetry consideration purely. It only allows for qualitative discussions since quark dof are not incorporated explicitly. 
% In addition, the magnetic dependence of $\alpha'$ is given at the leading order of $eB$, as shown in Eq.~(\ref{eq:magneticmass}). 
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% It should be no longer valid when $eB$ is large enough, say, the magnitude with order of $\mu_q^2$.

% Within the GL framework, not only the coefficients like $C_2$ but also the transverse velocity $v_\perp$ are still missing in the strong-field limit. The NJL result for $v_\perp$ in this limit is clearly deviated from $1/\sqrt{3}$~\cite{sen2015anisotropic}.

\section{Magnetic-induced vortex formations}
\label{sec:3}
%\vspace{0.2cm}

By introducing the magnetic-induced condensate, we have defined the less-symmetric ground state and
studied behavior of the effective gap in a homogenous MCFL phase. Before exploring possible topological
vortices consisting of MCFL, we give a brief review on the known vortex solutions consisting of CFL.

As seen in Eq.~(\ref{cfl}), the original QCD symmetry $G$ is broken to
the color-flavor locked symmetry $H$.
%,
%\begin{equation}
%  \label{eq:hgroup}
% H =SU(3)_{C+F} \times Z_3.
%\end{equation}
For the CFL phase, the diquark matrix $\Phi$ can be parameterized in the
topological space
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:cflvortexgroup}
  \frac{G}{H} \simeq \frac{SU(3) \times U(1)_B}{Z_3}  \simeq U(3),
\end{equation}
where $Z_3$ is a discrete symmetry.
Since the symmetry $U(1)_B$ is broken spontaneously, on the one hand, an usual superfluid vortex is generated.
In the cylindrical coordinates, the spatial configuration for a minimal-wound CFL vortex reads
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:bvortexphi}
\Phi =vf(r)e^{i \theta} \text{diag}(1,1,1),
\end{equation}
and equivalently
\begin{equation}
 d = vf(r)e^{i\theta}, \label{eq:bvortex}\end{equation}
due to Eq.~(\ref{eq:phi}). There, the polar angle $\theta$ originates from $U(1)_B$ breaking and
$f(r)$ is the profile function with the boundary
conditions $f(0) = 0$ and $f(\infty) =1$.

On the other hand, a particularly-interesting topological object has been suggested for
CFL more recently. Because of the non-Abelian structure of Eq.~(\ref{eq:cflvortexgroup}), the
diagonal elements of $\Phi$ are no longer degenerated in the resulting object and are called as
the ``non-Abelian'' vortices. For instance, the typical minimal-wound solution is given
as~\cite{nakano2008non,eto2009color}:
%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:nvortex}
  \Phi = v\begin{pmatrix}
   f(r)e^{i\theta} & & \\ & g(r) & \\ & & g(r)
  \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
which may be described by two of independent vortex solutions also~\cite{balachandran2006semisuperfluid}.
An important property of such kind of CFL vortices
%
is that the color-flavor-locked symmetry breaking pattern might change. In the vicinity of core of CFL
vortices, it has been pointed out that the locked symmetry $H={SU(3)_{C+F}}$ is broken to
$H' =U(1)_{C+F} \times SU(2)_{C+F}$ \cite{nakano2008non,vinci2012spontaneous}.
%%%also, namely $H={SU(3)_{C+F}} \rightarrow H' =U(1)_{C+F} \times SU(2)_{C+F}$
%% with Eq.~\eqref{eq:nvortex},
The Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with this breaking are of the orientational zero modes and they appear in the
topological space
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:cp2}
 \frac{H}{H'} = \frac{SU(3)_{C+F}}{U(1)_{C+F} \times SU(2)_{C+F}} = CP^2.
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

At this moment, we want to emphasize that the formation of CFL vortices itself bores no relation to an
external magnetic field. In other words, both $U(1)_{B}$ superfluid vortex and non-Abelian vortices are
generated spontaneously regardless of magnetic fields.
%%The two kinds of CFL vortex solutions ()
Once CFL has been replaced by MCFL, it is necessary to reexamine the formation mechanism of vortices in
the presence of an applied field $B$, as we shall show in the following.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\vspace{0.2cm}
\subsection{Superfluid vortex formation }
\label{sssec:4}
%\vspace{0.2cm}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Assuming that MCFL emerges inside the core of CFL non-Abelian vortices, the remaining subgroup $H'$ is
possible to be further broken to $M =SU(2)_{C+F}$ by enforcing the magnetic-induced breaking Eq.~(\ref{cfl2}).
In this case, the relevant order parameter for MCFL is parameterized in the topological space
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mcfsymm}
 \frac{H'}{M} = \frac{SU(2)_{C+F} \times U(1)_{C+F}}{SU(2)_{C+F}} = U(1)_{C+F},
\end{equation}
rather than the space $H/M$.
Because of the important role played by $\delta$ at large $B$, $U(1)_{C+F}$
breaking could be responsible for the $\delta$ condensate. Consequently, a superfluid vortex (string) is generated from $U(1)_{C+F}$ breaking, just like an usual $U(1)_B$ vortex for CFL. As the simplest
physical picture, this possibility shall be taken as our first step.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Similar as the $d$ string with Eq.~(\ref{eq:bvortex}), the vortex configuration for the resulting $\delta$
string is
\begin{equation}
	\delta= v_\delta f(r) e^{i\theta},\label{mcflvortex}
\end{equation}
where the phase angle $\theta$ arises from $U(1)_{C+F}$ breaking.
%%
For our purpose, it is convenient to employ the reduced Lagrangian of $\delta$
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mcflvorticehamilton}
 \mathcal{L}_\delta = (\partial \delta)^+ (\partial \delta) - \frac{\alpha'}{4}\delta^2 - \frac{\beta'}{4}\delta^4,
\end{equation}
instead of the original GL formalism with the matrix $\Phi$.
By inserting Eq.(\ref{mcflvortex}) into Euler-Lagrange equation, we obtain the profile function from
%of $\delta$-string
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:profilefunction}
 f'' + \frac{f'}{r} -\frac{f}{r^2} - (\frac{\alpha'}{4} + \frac{\beta'}{2} v_\delta^2 f^2)f=0,
\end{equation}
where $f'$ and $f''$ denote the first- and the second-order derivatives of $f(r)$ with respect to $r$,
respectively. Eq.~(\ref{eq:profilefunction}) is magnetic-field dependent as the coefficients $\alpha'$
and $\beta'$ are involved.
% the properties for  are expected different.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:2}, the profiles of $\delta$ string with two typical magnetic-field values (see the
solid line and the dashed line) are plotted. With varying magnetic fields, the shape of the profiles
is changed.

For a comparison with the CFL case, we consider a simple $U(1)_B$ vortex solution only and yield the
profile equation for the $d$ string
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:bvortexprofile}
  f'' + \frac{f'}{r} -\frac{f}{r^2} - (\frac{\alpha}{3} + \frac{8}{3}\beta v^2 f^2)f=0,
\end{equation}
from Eq.(\ref{eq:bvortex}) in a similar way.
% the Lagrangian of $d$.
%%%%%for $d$-string
%%\begin{equation}   \label{eq:bvortexlag}
% \mathcal{L}_d = (\partial d)^+ (\partial d) - \frac{\alpha}{3} d^2 - \frac{2 \beta}{3} d^4.
%\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The corresponding profile function, being magnetic-field independent, is shown by the dotted line in
Fig.~\ref{fig:2}. Now, a significant shape difference between the $d$- and $\delta$-profiles is observed.
Utilizing the characteristic radii of normal core in the two kinds of $U(1)$ vortices, it is clear that
the characteristic radius $R_d$ is far larger than the radius $R_\delta$.
%%
This result is not surprising. According to our assumptions, the $\delta$-string generation happens in
the core region of non-Abelian vortices. It means that the vortex-core size of the latter is required
to be larger than that of $\delta$ string. In the scope of CFL vortex solutions, the radius of $U(1)_B$ vortex, $R_d$, exceeds the mean radius of non-Abelian vortices. In this sense, the
above requirement is turned into a simple relation, $R_d > R_\delta$. We show this in Fig.~\ref{fig:2}.
%%

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{2.pdf}
	\caption{The profile functions of $\delta$ string with $eB = 4eB_0$ (red, solid) and $eB =
    5 eB_0$ (green, dashed) and the profile function of $d$ string (dotted).}
	\label{fig:2}
\end{figure}

Moreover, it is possible to derive the formation condition for $\delta$ string in a more formal way.
%For an usual superfluid string, i
It is well known that the magnitude of $R$, as a correlation length of the concerned condensate, may be
estimated by an inverse mass of the Higgs modes associated with $U(1)$ breaking~\cite{vilenkin2000cosmic}.
%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%
In the CFL case, the inverse mass of $\phi$ mode determines $R_d$ essentially.
%%%is decided by $m_\phi^{-1}$  (since the Higgs mode $\phi$ is responsible for $U(1)_{B}$ breaking).
By considering the Lagrangian of $d$ (see the Eq.~(\ref{eq:vortonb}) below), $R_d$ is estimated to be
$(-\alpha/3)^{-1/2}$.
%%
Similarly, $R_\delta$ is found to be about $(-\alpha'/4)^{-1/2}$ from Eq.~(\ref{eq:mcflvorticehamilton}).
%%%%%%%%
%Note that in our case the $\zeta$ mode is defined in CFL and it is not associated with $U(1)_{C+F}$
%breaking in MCFL.
%%square mass of $\zeta$ octet (being negative in the presence of magnetic field) does not decide the radius
%%$R_\delta$. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Based on these estimates, the relation $R_d > R_\delta$ is further turned into
$- 3\alpha' > - 4\alpha$. It behaves as the forming condition for $\delta$ string and corresponds to the region of magnetic field 
$eB > - 4\alpha+12\beta_2 v^2$. Numerically, the region is about $eB > \frac{7}{3} eB_0$ with the simplification $\beta_1=\beta_2=\beta = 1$.
The situations $eB = 4eB_0 $ and $5eB_0$ given in Fig.~\ref{fig:2} clearly fulfill the condition.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Also, it is time to explain the shape change of $\delta$-string profiles. Utilizing the language of
characteristic radius again, this result is easily understood from the $B$ dependence of $R_\delta$.
With increasing magnetic field, the value of $-\alpha'$ becomes larger such that the value of
$R_\delta$ is small relatively.
This is the reason why the spatial size of $\delta$-string profile tends to be suppressed as shown
in Fig.~\ref{fig:2}.

Finally, we study the kinetic energy of $\delta$ string per length unit. Physically, such kind of
linear tension might be roughly given by the area of profile function versus $r$. From Fig.~\ref{fig:2},
the difference in areas under two $\delta$-profiles indicates the existence of the $B$ dependence of
string tension.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Without loss of generality, the definition of string tension is expressed as
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{T} = \int^{2\pi}_{0}d\theta \int^L_{R_\delta}
\mathcal{H} rdr
\label{eq:tension},
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{H}$ denotes the system Hamiltonian.
Beside the vortex-core radius $R_\delta$, $L$ is introduced to account for the total radius of a
superfluid vortex. In this subsection, it is treated as a cut-off constant at which the boundary
conditions are $f =1$ and $f' =0$.
%%%
By using the $\delta$-profile equation Eq.~(\ref{eq:profilefunction}), we ignore the constant
contribution and give the asymptotic expression of string tension
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:tension1}
  \mathcal{T} \sim v_\delta^2 ln\frac{L}{R_\delta},
\end{equation}
%%%%
which can also be derived from the quantization of $U(1)$ string.

Based on Eq.~(\ref{eq:tension1}), let us examine the magnetic-field dependence of $\delta$-string tension.
For a stronger field, on the one hand, the vacuum expectation $v_\delta$ increases steadily.
On the other hand, the vortex-core radius $R_\delta$ has an opposite dependence, i.e. its value slightly
decreases as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:2}). With increasing $B$, therefore, the logarithmic-divergent
tendency becomes much more obvious for the tension energy. 
%%%%%
%It implies possible instability in a straight, global string that made up of the $\delta$-condensate only.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%\vspace{0.2cm}
\subsection{Formation of vorton structure }
\label{sssec:5}
%\vspace{0.2cm}

Now we turn to a more complicated situation where both $\delta$- and $d$-condensate exhibit the
spatial-dependent properties simultaneously. Instead of the above-discussed picture, there exists a
theoretical possibility that the two strings from $U(1)$ breaking allow for the existence of vortons,
a topologically and energetically stable object. The scenario of vortons was first considered in the
scope of cosmic
string~\cite{vilenkin2000cosmic,witten1985superconducting,davis1988physics1,davis1988physics2,haws1988superconducting}.
For color superconducting matter of dense QCD, the vorton formation was studied in the case of introducing the
condensates of two Nambu-Goldstone modes, say, $K^0$ and $K^+$, in the CFL environment. As the $K^+$ and $K^0$ condensed strings are generated from $U(1)$ breaking, their coexistence was pointed out to support the stable vortons under somewhat conditions~\cite{kaplan2002charged,buckley2002superconducting}. 
%%%%%%
%electromagnetic $U(1)$ and hypercharge $U(1)$ symmetry breaking, respectively. In Refs.\cite{kaplan2002charged,bedaque2011vortons,buckley2002superconducting}, \cite{bedaque2011vortons}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
Even though these condensates due to flavor asymmetry are not mentioned, the present-concerned system involves both two condensates as well. As long as the $d$- and
$\delta$-condensate are assumed to arise from $U(1)_B$ and $U(1)_{C+F}$ breaking respectively, the essential physics
behind magnetic color-flavor-locked matter should share some analogy with that discussed in the literature.
%

Our starting point is that the $d$-string is generated while the $\delta$ condensate is expected to emerge
at the $d$-string centre. The former can be regarded as a usual, straight vortex temporarily parallel to the
$z$ direction. Similar to the Eq.~(\ref{eq:bvortex}), it has the form of $d = d(r)e^{i\theta}$.
%%
Along the $z$ direction, the $\delta$ condensed field carry non-vanishing charge and current as its emergence
is inside the string core. Without losing generality, the ansatz for such a nontrivial $\delta$ vortex solution reads
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:delta}
  \delta =  e^{i(kz+\omega t)}\delta(r),
\end{equation}
which is different from the $\delta$ string in Sec.~\ref{sssec:4}. The frequency $\omega$ contributes to the conserved
Noether charge $Q$ via
 \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vortonquantumq}
   Q = \omega\int dz \int dS \delta^2,
 \end{equation}
where $S$ denotes the area being perpendicular to $z$ axis. Similarly, the wave number $k$ will contribute to the
current $J$ along $z$ axis via $J =k\int dz \int dS \delta^2$ in the minimal-wound case.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We first investigate the necessary and sufficient conditions for existence of $\delta$ condensate
at the $d$-string centre.
For this purpose, we will consider the simplest theory with two order parameters, say
a $U(1) \times U(1)$ model Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}(d,\delta)= \mathcal{L}_d +
\mathcal{L}_\delta + \mathcal{L}_{d\delta}$.
%%
The Lagrangian of $d$ field is easily written in the Mexican-hat form
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vortonb}
  \mathcal{L}_d  = |\partial d|^2 +\frac{\alpha}{6 v^2}(d^2 - v^2)^2,
\end{equation}
where the known vacuum Eq.~(\ref{eq:dvaccum}) has been used to eliminate the coefficient $\beta$.
For the $\delta$ field, as stressed in Sec.~\ref{sec:2}, it is totally decided by the coefficient
$\alpha'$ rather than $\alpha$. The Lagrangian has been given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:deltapotential1}), equivalently
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vortond}
  \mathcal{L}_\delta = |\partial \delta|^2 + \frac{\alpha'}{8 v_\delta^2}(\delta^2 - v_\delta^2)^2.
\end{equation}
The term with $d$ and $\delta$ mixing, being important for a $U(1) \times U(1)$ model,  may be formally written as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vortoninter}
  \mathcal{L}_{d\delta} = -\lambda d^2 \delta^2,
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is required positive.
%%
Recalling the original GL Lagrangian with the matrix $\Phi$, this term needs to
%e coefficient $\lambda$ should
be associated with the contributions from $\alpha$ and $\beta_2$ (exactly, $\alpha'$) at the same time. In order to guarantee
that the resulting Lagrangian is theoretically controllable and resembles a
simple $U(1) \times U(1)$ model, we pick upon the relevant terms
in expansion of Eq.~(\ref{gl}) and define the coefficient as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vortoninter1}
  \lambda = -\frac{1}{3 v^2}(\alpha' +\frac{\alpha}{3}).
\end{equation}

Apparently, introducing the ansatz in Eq.~\ref{eq:delta} leads to the changes in the formalism.
% of $\mathcal{L}_\delta$.
In particular, the effective potential for $\delta$ field becomes
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vortond1}
  \mathcal{V}_\delta= -\frac{\alpha'}{8v_\delta^2} [\delta^2 - (v_\delta^2 - \frac{8v_\delta^2}{\alpha'}(\omega^2 -k^2))]^2 \ ,
\end{equation}
rather than the formalism Eq.~(\ref{eq:deltapotential1}).
%%
In the vacuum with $d \neq 0$ and $\delta = 0$, the effective potential provides the additional
contribution to the Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}_d$. To guarantee the $d$-field symmetry is broken such
that $d \neq 0$, it is necessary to require that the vacuum contribution (constant term) is positive.
By considering Eqs.~(\ref{eq:vortonb}) and (\ref{eq:vortond1}), the condition reads
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vortonb2}
  \frac{\alpha}{6} v^2 < \frac{\alpha'}{8v_\delta^2}(v_\delta^2  - \frac{8v_\delta^2}{\alpha'}(\omega^2 -k^2))^2.
\end{equation}
On the other hand, the Lagrangian of $\delta$ needs to be examined in such a vacuum. To guarantee the
$\delta$-field symmetry remains unbroken such that $\delta = 0$, it is required that the quadratic
coefficient of $\delta$ is positive. By using Eq.~(\ref{eq:vortond1}) again and considering the mixed
term, we yield the another condition such as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vortonb3}
  \lambda v^2 + \frac{\alpha'}{4}- \omega^2 +k^2 > 0.
\end{equation}

The conditions Eqs.~(\ref{eq:vortonb2}) and (\ref{eq:vortonb3}) are not sufficient to yield the vacuum
with $d = 0$ and $\delta \neq 0$ which emerges at the centre of $d$ string. Contrary to the
Eq.~(\ref{eq:vortonb3}), the requirement that the $\delta^2$ coefficient is negative seems to result in
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vortonb4}
\omega^2 - k^2 -\frac{\alpha'}{4} > 0 \ .
\end{equation}
Here, the mixed term with $\lambda$ does not take effect at classical level. Note that $\delta$ is of
the quantum solution essentially, its temporal gradient energy cost should also be taken into account.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
For the ground state of $\delta$ condensate, one may add such a perturbation term as $e^{i\nu t}$ and
substitute it into Eq.~(\ref{eq:vortond1}). Note that the mode associated with $\nu$ is actually required
to possess a negative eigenvalue~\cite{vilenkin2000cosmic,haws1988superconducting}, a more accurate form
of the sufficient condition is given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vortonb5}
  \omega^2 - k^2 -\frac{\alpha'}{4} > \sqrt{- \frac{2}{3}\alpha \lambda v^2}.
\end{equation}
Only if the conditions Eqs.~(\ref{eq:vortonb2}), (\ref{eq:vortonb3}) and (\ref{eq:vortonb5}) are
satisfied at the same time, there exist not merely the $d$ condensate in the region with large $r$, but
also the $\delta$ condensate in vicinity of the region with $r \rightarrow 0$.

%%Before going to the specifics of vorton structure,
Then, we derive the profile equations based on the Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}(d,\delta)$.
It is easy to obtain the profile function of $d$ string from
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:deuler}
  d'' +\frac{d'}{r} - \frac{d}{r^2} - (\lambda \delta^2 + \frac{\alpha}{3})d + \frac{\alpha}{3v^2}d^3 = 0,
\end{equation}
where the mixed term has played its role.
%% 
For the profile function of $\delta$ condensate, its motion equation may be written as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:beuler}
  \delta'' +\frac{\delta'}{r} - \frac{\delta}{r^2} - (k^2 - \omega^2)\delta - (\lambda d^2 + \frac{\alpha'}{4})\delta + \frac{\alpha'}{4v_\delta^2}\delta^3 = 0 \ .
\end{equation}
Comparing with the $\delta$-string result Eq.~(\ref{eq:profilefunction}) obtained in Sec.~\ref{sssec:4},
not only the mixed term, but also the contributions from $k^2$ and $\omega^2$ are involved.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In principle, both profiles would be affected by an external magnetic field. For the $d$ string, it comes
from the coefficient $\lambda$. Even so, it is difficult to investigate the magnetic-field dependence
because of the severe conditions Eqs.~(\ref{eq:vortonb2}), (\ref{eq:vortonb3}) and (\ref{eq:vortonb5}).
%%
For certainty, let us consider the limit of $\omega^2 = k^2$ which corresponds to a
critical situation for our concerned $\delta$ condensate ~\cite{lemperiere2003behaviour}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this case, the magnetic-field values fulfilling three of conditions are found to be ``confined" to a
rather narrow region.
%%narrow enough and it is actually limited
Numerically, the appropriate value of $eB$ is about $2 eB_0$ with the simplifications used above.
%%$eB \simeq 2 eB_0$ numerically.
When a magnetic field is out of (exactly larger than) it, the vortex solution with Eq.~(\ref{eq:delta})
is likely to decay into an usual string discussed in Sec.~\ref{sssec:4}.
%%(with  $\beta_1=\beta_2=\beta = 1$).
%%, the region is required to be  approximately.  region
% at  which satisfies conditions Eqs.(\ref{eq:vortonb2}), (\ref{eq:vortonb3}) and
%(\ref{eq:vortonb5}), as well as $eB > eB_0$ of course.

With the boundary conditions $\delta(r \rightarrow 0) = v_\delta$ and $\delta(r \rightarrow \infty) = 0$
as well as the usual boundaries for $d$, we plot the two of profile functions in Fig.~\ref{fig:3}.
%%  of $d$- and $\delta$-fields are plotted. As expected,
It is clear that the non-vanishing $\delta$ fields emerge only inside the core region of $d$ string.
The similar behavior had been obtained in the literature and it opens the possibility of a nontrivial
vorton structure. Also, Fig.~\ref{fig:3} is worthy of discussions by utilizing the language of the
total radius $L$.
%% (rather than the radius $R$ discussed above).
From a comparison of the spatial thickness, it is observed that $L$ for $d$ string is far larger than
$L_\delta$ for $\delta$ string. This result implies that, when the vorton structure is introduced, no
complicated curvature effect appears so that the energy of the system can be calculated in a relatively
simple manner.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

     }
	\label{fig:3}
\end{figure}

Finally, it is time to introduce a proper spatial configuration and construct a vorton state.
% analyze its stability from the energy view.
%%
To obtain a finite energy for the $d$ vortex, the simple choices are that it exists in a finite
container or it forms a closed circular loop.
Our concerned spatial configuration is the latter case. When a straight $d$ string is bent to a
closed loop (ring), $z$ denotes the direction along a ring and the ring radius becomes $L$.
Consequently, the phase change of $\delta$ field and thus the charge/current actually happen in
the ring direction. This is just the picture of vortons (also known as string loops, vortex rings).
In Ref.~\cite{bedaque2011vortons}), a vorton state was illustrated in Fig. 1 for the $K^0$ and
$K^+$ fields. In the present situation, the $d$ field changes in the arrow of $K^0$ while the
$\delta$ field, like $K^+$, does along the direction of ring.
%%%%%%%%%%%
%%.

Now that a linkage of two vortices has been realized, the next step is to investigate the energy of a vorton state
and analyze its stability. For the demonstrative purpose, we will discuss the contributions from $d$ and
$\delta$, respectively. For the $d$-string, its length is $2 \pi L$ as a closed loop.
Suppose its linear tension is $\mathcal{T}_d$, the energy for $d$ vortex is given by
$\mathcal{E}_d = 2\pi L \mathcal{T}_d$. As seen this energy is mainly decided by $L$. 
%%%%%
%Note that the logarithmic dependence of $\mathcal{T}_d$, c.f. Eq.~(\ref{eq:tension1}, is not too obvious
%in a large $L$ case). 
If the system were made up of $d$ singly, thus, it would prefer to shrink
rather than expand.
%%%%
%bviously the state with $L\rightarrow 0$ is not expected one. With increasing $L$, in addition,
%such kind of system has the infrared divergence which is a generic feature of global vortices.
%%%%%%%% so that the $\delta$-condensate contribution needs to be taken into account seriously.
%%%%%
From the Hamiltonian for $\delta$ field, on the other hand, the $\delta$-vortex energy is expressed as 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:deltah}
  \mathcal{E}_\delta = \int dz \int dS  (\nabla_r \delta)^2 + (k^2 + \omega^2)\delta^2 + (\lambda d^2 + \frac{\alpha'}{4})\delta^2 - \frac{\alpha'}{8v_\delta^2}\delta^4.
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
By considering the profile equation Eq.~(\ref{eq:beuler}), it is reduced to
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:energydelta}
  \mathcal{E}_{\delta} =  2\pi L\frac{\alpha' \Sigma_4}{8v_\delta^2} + 4 \pi L \omega^2 \Sigma_2,
\end{equation}
where $\Sigma_2$ and $\Sigma_4$ are short for
$\Sigma_2 = \int dS \delta^2$ and $\Sigma_4 = \int dS \delta^4$ respectively.
In view of the fact that the quantity $Q$ defined by Eq.~(\ref{eq:vortonquantumq}) is
conserved during variation of $L$, the energy can be further simplified as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:energydelta1}
  \mathcal{E}_{\delta} =  2\pi L\frac{\alpha' \Sigma_4}{8v_\delta^2} + \frac{Q^2}{\pi L \Sigma_2}.
\end{equation}
Note that the last term in RHS of Eq.~(\ref{eq:energydelta1}) has the
$L^{-1}$ behavior. 
%%% 
This implies that the system made up of $\delta$ might prefer expanding of a vorton in somewhat situations.
%

Now, it is the competition between two kind of tendencies, shrinking and expanding, to make an energetically-stable vorton state possible. For the total energy $\mathcal{E} = \mathcal{E}_\delta + \mathcal{E}_d$, we minimize it versus $L$ and obtain the stabilized radius from  
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vortonr}
 L_0^2 = \frac{Q^2}{2\pi^2\Sigma_2(\mathcal{T}_d +
   \frac{\alpha' \Sigma_4}{8v_\delta^2})}.
\end{equation}
At the radius $L_0$, the stable energy for a vorton state behaves as a
function of $Q$ and $L$, say, $\mathcal{E}_0 = 2 Q^2/(\pi L_0 \Sigma_2)$.
%%%
Different from a straight string, the vorton energy is no longer divergent. In other words, the infrared divergence of $\mathcal{T}_d$, c.f. Eq.~(\ref{eq:tension1}), has been eliminated due to the vorton structure.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

It is crucial to further examine stable vortons in the astrophysical ``Laboratories" such like the interior of compact stars.
Unfortunately, there still exist some of important aspects which are not dealt with in the present study. 
First of all, the profile behaviors Fig.~\ref{fig:3} is obtained from the critical situation $\omega^2 = k^2$ (but the discussion of vorton energy does not depend on this limit). When $\omega^2 \neq k^2$ is taken into account, existences of $Q$ and $J$ might be important. For instance, a vorton state might be destroyed by a large current $J$ in the context of cosmic string ~\cite{vilenkin2000cosmic}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%
Secondly, it is assumed in this section that the $\delta$ field stems out of $U(1)_{C+F}$ breaking.
If the rotated electromagnetic mechanism remains valid, nevertheless, the $\delta$ condensate itself could be classified into two species, say, these from $\zeta^+$ and $\zeta^-$excitations, in the sense of $U(1)_{\widetilde{Q}}$. 
Naively, two kinds of fields should have the opposite orbiting directions in the presence of magnetic fields.
In this case, it is necessary to build more realistic models and study the electromagnetic properties for vortons. 
At the same time, the geometry of vorton structure needs to be reexamined. These details will leave for future studies. We hope that the basic forming mechanism presented here may survive various corrections.

\section{Summary and discussions}
\label{sec:4}
%\vspace{0.2cm}

%%%%%%%%%
Within the GL framework, we investigated effect of a rotated, external magnetic field on
color-flavor-locked-type matter. Instead of pretending to derive a Lagrangian, we attributed
magnetic effect to the response of charged Higgs modes.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Since the most-symmetric CFL phase is regarded as the known solution, our treatment is of an effective theory
concentrating on corrections to the known results, namely, changes in non-Abelian Higgs spectrum and the
traceless part of GL potential. With help of the magnetic-induced condensate $\delta$, it can demonstrate a
less-symmetric MCFL phase without introducing more details on CFL such like weak-coupling analyses for the
CFL gap.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Moreover, we explored possible formation of vortices consisting of MCFL.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Assuming that such kind of object is generated inside core region of the known CFL vortices, we simplified
the magnetic-induced symmetry breaking as $U(1)_{C+F}$ breaking. As the consequences, a superfluid-like
vortex string made up of the $\delta$-condensate was constructed and then the discussion was extended to the situation where not merely the $\delta$-condensate but also the $d$-condensate are incorporated. For the first time, a novel scenario
for vorton formation was suggested in the scope of magnetic color-flavor-locked matter of dense QCD.
%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the present work, we only considered the ideal situation with a uniform, flavor-independent value for
color-superconducting gaps. In fact, the CFL gaps themselves need to be differentiated according to their
microscopic content. In view of that the diquark condensate made up of rotated-charge neutral quarks is
different from that of opposite-charged quarks, there exist distinctive magnetic responses for two species
of condensates. It leads to the splitting behavior of gaps, which is the another side of the same coin
regarding magnetic effect. The influences of gap splitting on the CFL vortices had been reported in our
previous work~\cite{zhang2015magnetic}. It is beyond the scope of current
paper since we focus on the exploration of the vortices consisting of MCFL.
%%%originates from quark-photon interactions
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%To handle the detailed gap changes, further improvements should concern both the magnetic-induced contribution from charged Higgs modes (employed in this paper) and the contribution from charged quarks (which is not included so far).
%
More complexities come from the realistic situations. When a large strange-flavor mass is considered,
the color-flavor-locked symmetry becomes violated. In this case, CFL with $K$ condensate and the
resulting vortex solutions need to be included as well~\cite{kaplan2002charged,buckley2002superconducting}.

Another element missing in this work is rotated gluons originated from the rotated electromagnetic mechanism. Within the present GL framework the gluon dof with non-vanishing Meissner mass have been ignored for simplicity. 
In the situation of strong gauge coupling, it is reasonable to assume that the gluon fields by themselves did not affect the symmetry breaking induced by an external background field $B$. Once the rotated gluons are taken into account, nevertheless,  the corresponding color magnetic field could play the role on formation of non-Abelian CFL vortices. When the topological object consisting of CFL are regarded as color magnetic fluxes, for instance, the gluon interactions as well as the gluon-photon mixing had been found relevant for the stability and electromagnetic properties \cite{vinci2012spontaneous,eto2010instabilities,iida2005magnetic}.
In this case the current schemes of MCFL vortices, in particular the superfluid string, need to be further reexamined.
%%%%%%
On the other hand, a rich physics lies in the interplay of rotated gluons with the applied field $B$.
By considering magnetic responses of gluons (through their rotated charges), this issue had been studied within gluon mean-field theory at high densities~\cite{ferrer2006magnetic}. 
Another kind of vortices with gluon condensate were predicted which are totally different from our concerned vortices with diquark condensates. Also, it was pointed out that the anti-screening effect is possible for very strong (external) magnetic fields. 
Together with the above-mentioned topics, further studies on influences of rotated gluons on the vortices consisting of magnetic color-flavor-locked matter are interesting undoubtedly. Towards this goal, it is an important task to deeply understand the implications of $\delta$ from microscopic viewpoint and bridge ``gaps" between the model-independent approach and the phenomenological quark/gluon model. We need to incorporate quark/gluon interactions with rotated photons in a more consistent manner. Also, the non-perturbative method rooted in full QCD might be necessary. Possible improvements in theoretical methods will be explored in future studies.

% Suppose that, except for $(m_\zeta^{eff})^2$, the formalism describing CFL remains unchanged, a GL Lagrangian with the medium-dependent coefficient can be constructed. 
% It is an effective theory because the CFL phase is pre-defined while only the corrections to the known CFL results are concerned. 
% In the most-symmetric ground state, indeed, only the diagonal elements are involved in the diquark matrix, namely
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq:phi}
%   \Phi =
%   \begin{pmatrix}
%     d & 0 & 0 \\
%     0 & d & 0 \\
%     0 & 0 & d
%     \end{pmatrix}.\end{equation}
% %%where $d$ represents color-flavor-locked condensate.
% As the color-flavor-locked condensate, $d$ is rotated-charge neutral and the corresponding Higgs
% modes are also neutral. Since these modes do not respond to magnetic field directly, the above effective Lagrangian usually does
% not influence the CFL description. By inserting Eq.~(\ref{eq:phi})
% into the Lagrangian, for instance, there are no essential changes since the traceless potential with
% $(m_\zeta^{eff})^2$ is irrelevant to the diagonal matrix element $d$ and its uniform vacuum $v$.

% The ground state of color-flavor-locked-type matter would change
% if additional condensates are taken into account. 
% %%%
% %The present strategy isto introduce this condensate. 
% %%%%%%%
% By using the effective Lagrangian with $(m_\zeta^{eff})^2$, we shall consider the possible condensates except $d$.
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% For this purpose, 
% let us firstly investigate the rotated-charge properties of these matrix elements.
